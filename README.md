# <span style="color: royalblue;">Week 5: GANs</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; color: royalblue;">Kaggle Competition Project: I'm Something of a Painter Myself:</span>

In this week's module we were introduced to general adversarial networks (GAN). GANs typically have two neural networks, one being a generator and the other being a discriminator. They work against each other to accomplish a specific task, and in the case of this assignment, to generate images in a certain style.

More explicitly, I will use a GAN to generate images in the style of Monet. The GAN has a generator neural network that will generate images in the style of Monet. The discriminator neural network will try to determine if the generated image is a *real* Monet image or a fake image. As the models train, the generator will work on improving the quality of the image to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator will work on improving it's ability to detect real and fake Monet images.

The results will be submitted to the Kaggle competition to see how well the model can create images in the style of Monet.

## Notebook is large (23.5 MB) and takes a while to load. Please be patient :-) It takes about 30 seconds for me for it to show up.
